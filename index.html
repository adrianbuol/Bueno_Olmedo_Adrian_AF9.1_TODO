            <h2>LONDON</h2>
            <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in
                the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London
                has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.</p>
            <p>The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and
                colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
